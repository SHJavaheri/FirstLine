## Overview

**FirstLine** is a professional discovery platform developed by **Northbound**, designed to help individuals find, evaluate, and connect with trusted professionals quickly, transparently, and confidently.

The platform addresses a widespread and deeply rooted problem: finding reliable professionals, such as lawyers, accountants, consultants, and other specialists, is often inefficient, opaque, and driven by advertising rather than merit. FirstLine replaces this uncertainty with a structured, intelligent system built around clarity, relevance, and trust.

FirstLine is being built as a modern, scalable web application with a strong emphasis on user experience, performance, and long-term reliability.
